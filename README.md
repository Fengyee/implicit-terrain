# ImplicitTerrain: Continuous Surface Modeling for Terrain Data Analysis

## Introduction
ImplicitTerrain leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model high-resolution terrain continuously and differentiably, enhancing the accuracy of surface representation and topological information restoration. This project offers a novel pipeline, making use of the Surface-plus-Geometry (SPG) cascaded INR model for terrain surface modeling, maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and enabling direct topological analysis on the continuous manifold.

## Key Features
- **High Fidelity Surface Modeling:** Utilizes a novel SPG model for precise terrain representation.
- **Progressive Training Strategy:** Improves convergence speed and efficiency during model training from coarse to fine scales.
- **Topological and Topographical Analysis:** Integrates extracted topological features with discrete Morse theory and supports calculations of various topographical features directly from surface derivatives.
